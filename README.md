<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>API made with Node.JS, Express.JS and MongoDB</p>
<p>Developed the CRUD features with routes, models and controllers and also connection with MongoDB to persist data</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<p>Create, read, update and delete books and authors from the bookshop via API requests</p>
<p>Search for books using the publisher (editora) information via "/livros/busca?editora="</p>

To configure and create the API, I worked with Node, Express.JS to create routes, controllers and models. I also worked with MongoDB to configure the database and allow data to persist correctly.

Since it is a CRUD, for now, the API allows the creation, modification, deletion and viewing of registered books, as well as authors and searches by publisher.
